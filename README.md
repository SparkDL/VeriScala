# VeriScala

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ScalaHDL/VeriScala.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ScalaHDL/VeriScala)

VeriScala is a tool that you can write Scala code to generate Verilog code run on FPGA in order to:

* Use less time write code on FPGA
* Available to develop on FPGA for people who don't have much hardware knowledge
* Generated code has been optimized, use less resource and have better performance
* Use high-level custom type, like Complex Number

### TODO List

* Multiple module support
* Custom type support
* Float-point base type support

### Versions

* In pre-alpha

### Usage
TODO
