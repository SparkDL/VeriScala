# ScalaHDL
ScalaHDL is a tool that you can write Scala code to generate Verilog code run on FPGA in order to:

* Use less time write code on FPGA
* Available to develop on FPGA for people who don't have much hardware knowledge
* Generated code has been optimized, use less resource and have better performance

### TODO List

* Stronger type system
* Type safe
* Float-point support
